Welcome to the Flow Control Tutorial!
Prerequesites: Data Types

In this tutorial, we will allow the computer to make decisions.
All computers need to make decisions, such as:
"if this one thing is correct, then do another thing", or
"continue doing this until this other thing happens".

In games, we always expect a player to die when they run out of health.
However, if we dont tell the computer to kill the player when they run out
of health, then the player will never die, their health will go negative

We also expect the game to continue running forever, until the user wants
to quit the game, we dont want the game to suddenly freeze or crash on them.

This tutorial addresses how to use "if" statements, and "while" statements.
